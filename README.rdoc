Welp is a yelp-like application, that allows users to review restaurants, based on where they are currently located. At the moment, a user must be within a quarter mile of the restaurant they wish to review. 

Welp is optimized for mobile, as the core idea of the app is for users to review the establishment immediately following the conclusion of their dining experience. 

Welp utilizes Rails, jQuery, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and the Yelp and Google geolocation API's.

Currently, only works in SF.
